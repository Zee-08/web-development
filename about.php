                	<p class="para mb-3">Asia’s major, world’s second-largest, and second-highest cable car project, the Gondola ride in Gulmarg in Kashmir is the leading attraction. A Gulmarg tour is incomplete without a ride on the famous cable car. This must-do activity in Gulmarg is ideal for adventurers seeking, romantic couples, and family vacationers to get to the top of the peak for a pleasing skiing experience (in winter).</p>
                	<p class="para mb-lg-3">The Gulmarg Gondola ride is a widely renowned activity exclusively offered in Gulmarg town in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Known to be the second-highest and the second-longest cable car in the world, it attracts thousands of tourists and thrillseekers throughout the year. It is a two-stage gondola lift that has the potential to ferry approximately 600 individuals per hour from and to Kongdoori Mountain. This brilliant ropeway project is a joint venture of the government of Jammu and Kashmir and a French company named Pomagalski. The first stage of the Gulmarg Gondola was finished in 1998, and the second stage took two years to complete and was opened in 2005. An additional third phase was added to the Gulmarg Gondola back in 2011 for skiing enthusiasts, which features 90 chairlifts connecting Kongdoori to Mary’s Shoulder.
						The Gulmarg Gondola ride is a fun recreational activity and is one of the prime highlights of Gulmarg tourism. It has been operational for more than two decades now, offering a unique experience to tourists. Individuals of nearly all ages can participate in this fun activity when they visit Gulmarg in Jammu and Kashmir. </p>
					<p class="para mb-lg-3">In this activity, individuals get to ride a cable car that takes them from Gulmarg to Kungdoor Station and then Kongdoori Mountain to Apharwat Peak. At the stops, visitors can spend time amidst the snow-capped mountains and tall pine trees and grab a hot cup of coffee while soaking in the panoramic scenic views.</p>

					<h3>Red Fort or Lal Qila</h3>
					<p class="para mt-3 mb-lg-4 ">The Red Fort in Delhi, also known as Lal Qila, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a magnificent symbol of India's rich history. Built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1648, this imposing red sandstone fort served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. Its iconic architecture includes the Lahori Gate, Diwan-i-Aam, Diwan-i-Khas, and lush gardens. The fort is not only a testament to Mughal grandeur but also a site of historical significance, as it is where the Prime Minister hoists the national flag every Independence Day, reaffirming its status as a symbol of India's sovereignty and heritage.</p>
